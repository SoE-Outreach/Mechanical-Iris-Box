# Notes
It was drawn on SolidWorks 2022. The SLDPRT file is uploaded.
This kit is created to be laser cut with 3mm thick material. Suitable material: MDF, plywood, composite board, acrylic... 

Individual part dxf files are in the "CAD File" folder.

A flat pack version of the kit in dxf format, created to save time and hassle, is uploaded under "Iris Box 100mm V1.1 with question.dxf".
The university logo is not included in the dxf, as dxf is unable to hold image file.

Instructions to assemble is also uploaded. It is due for an update, a newer version will be uploaded as soon as it is available.
